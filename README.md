# Project_Libra-xTB

This repository contains the files to perform NA-MD simulations in the extended tight-binding (xTB) framework for Si nanocrystals (NCs) of different sizes and a 2D 
graphitic carbon nitride monolayer.


More details on how to run the code are brought in [Libra CompChemCyberTraining](https://github.com/compchem-cybertraining/Tutorials_Libra/tree/master/6_dynamics/2_nbra_workflows) repository. Detailed explanations about installation and running the CP2K inputs can be found in [here](https://github.com/compchem-cybertraining/Tutorials_CP2K).

**Note:** To uncompress some of the tar files that contain the coordinates and have been split you can do this in the folders:

```
cat *.tar.bz2.part* > file.tar.gz.joined
tar xvf file.tar.gz.joined
```
